# QLearning



1. Model-free reinforcement learning algorithm to learn the value of an action in a particular state
      -"Q" refers to the function that the algorithm computes â€“ the expected rewards for an action taken in a given state
      -Learning refers to the iterating of the algorithm as it computes data
2. Reinforcement learning is the process of putting an AI into an environment and then giving it a specified amount of possible moves. Then you update the AI over and over until you get the outcome you want
3. It does not require a model of the environment
4. IDK which of his projects use Q-Learning but I know that they do. https://www.youtube.com/@CodeBullet
